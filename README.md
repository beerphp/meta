*This is the repo behind the repos.*

Please create a Github issue on this repository for anything related to BeerPHP generally,
for example, to ask for the creation of a new repo for your local chapter of BeerPHP.

We use Github (this website!) to discuss things.
If you're not used to that, here's a [quick video intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlrJVSJRUN4).

Feel free to create a pull request if you have useful resources for our group.

## Fork a BeerPHP in your city

Anyone can do it - why not you? Please open an issue on this repo and clearly state:
- **The github usernames of everyone who should be an admin on the repo**. We find that having at least 2 is best, but if it's just you, that's fine for now.
- **The name of the repo**. this becomes the url slug, eg `beerphp/foo`. If your city has a short name, like an airport code, that's fine. whatever you like that's still recognizable as your city.
- **Bonus: gifs or emoji** are always welcome.
- We will try to get you setup within in a couple of days. Sometimes it may take a little longer as this is us giving time to the PHP community. Please have a little patience if things do not happen as fast as you want. It's totally ok to ask for an update in the comments :)


Once you have a repo created, encourage people in your town to "watch" the repo to subscribe to notifications for issues on Github.
Issues are a great way to propose, plan, and remind people of upcoming events.
Filling out a readme, description, and optional URL to your repo will help people know what's going on and want to come to your cool event.
Feel free to borrow text and formatting from other BeerPHP repos.

## Get help organizing

A great way is to open an issue, or browse through some of the repos from other cities to see what they're up to.

## Assets

Feel free to use any stuff from the `/assets` folder of this repo for the benefit of the community. 
We always publish source files so you can easily change it and specify your city.

## Code of conduct

All events, activities, and internet spaces which bear the BeerPHP name are subject to the [Conf Code of Conduct](http://confcodeofconduct.com/).
Simply stated, harassment of any form will not be tolerated and should be reported to your local organizer.
Please drink responsibly and act in a way that honors the community values of respect and mutual enrichment which we share.

## A note about beer

BeerPHP is about creating social spaces to strengthen software communities. There is no requirement to drink to participate.


Cheers & beers :beers:,

BeerPHP.
